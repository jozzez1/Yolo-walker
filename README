I Introduction
----------------------------
A simple 2 player game, based on a board game I played one summer, whose name I cannot remember.


II Game rulez
-----------------------------
The game has a simple rules: your objective is to reach the other side of the board before your
opponent. Each turn you can move in either direction (not diagonal) or build a wall to annoy your
competitor.

III Current Objectives
-----------------------------
* program it in C++, with Qt library,
* use cURL library for playing over the web
* create simple board, images and so on with gimp
* create a very simple brute force AI for playing alone

IV License
-----------------------------
GPL, since we use Qt, I guess. Or GPL compatible license, like
WTFPL :P.

V Credits
-----------------------------
I think it's to early at this point for credits, but we put them here just for the LULZ anyway.
