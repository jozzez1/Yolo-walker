I Introduction
----------------------------
A simple 2 player game, based on a board game I played one summer,
whose name I cannot remember.


II Game rulez
-----------------------------
The game has simple rules: your objective is to reach the other
side of the board before your opponent. Each turn you can move in
either direction (not diagonal) or build a wall to annoy your
competitor.

III-a DONE
-----------------------------
a) simple player class
b) simple board class
c) engine class

   d) turn mechanism:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   1 Engine checks the turn, based on it decides which player has to
   move.

   2 `player' class takes the input ( <-- not done yet), and presents
   his turn to the engine. If the engine determines the turn is valid,
   it moves to the other player, if the turn is invalid, the player
   has to repeat his move.

   3 after the move was valid, engine updates the player and the board
   classes. After this it checks, if either player has achieved victory.
   If so, the game is over. Otherwise, the game continues.

e) added a sample tile, with player tokens using Inkscape.

III-b TO-DO
-----------------------------
* ! CHANGE SDL LIBRARY TO 2.0 ! 
* create the function for player input (keyboard/mouse) using SDL
* create more tile images for the board
* create the tile class, with an image and coordinates
* create a very simple brute force AI for playing alone
* use cURL library for playing over the web

IV Arhitecture
-----------------------------
	Game
	|----Engine (all game logic, START(), MOVE())
		|----Input (provides all user input)
		|----Player (which player, cordinates)
		|----Wall (which wall, coordinates)
		|----Board (paint canvas for graphics to be shown; int n*n table )
			|----Tile (images drown on canvas)

V License
-----------------------------
GPL, since we will use SDL, I guess. Or GPL compatible license, like
WTFPL :P.

V Credits
-----------------------------
I think it's to early at this point for credits, but we put them here just for the LULZ anyway.
